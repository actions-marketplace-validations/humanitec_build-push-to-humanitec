This action builds a container image from a Dockerfile, then pushes the image to the Humanitec registry and finally
notifies the Humanitec platform that a new build is available.

## Inputs

### `humanitec-token`

**Required** The API token provided by the platform. This should be stored as a GitHub Repository Secret and then passed
to the action using a variable expansion. For example, if the token is store as a secret with name `HUMANITEC_TOKEN`,
the following code should be used to pass it to the action:

```
    uses: humanitec/build-push-to-humanitec@v1
      with:
        humanitec-token: ${{ secrets.HUMANITEC_TOKEN }}
        organization: awesome-company
```

### `organization`

**Required** The name of the organization that the image will be built for.

### `image-name`

_Optional_ The name you want to refer to the image to in the Humanitec Platform. The id must be all lowercase letters,
numbers and the "-" symbol. It cannot start or end with "-".

### `file`

### `context`

### `dockerfile`

      with:
        humanitec-token: ${{ secrets.HUMANITEC_TOKEN }}
        organization: awesome-company
        tag: latest
```

### `auto-tag`

_Optional_ Use `auto-tag` when you want to push tags/release by their git name (e.g. `refs/tags/MY_TAG_NAME`).  
> CAUTION: Images produced by this feature can be overwritten by branches with the same name - without a way to restore.

```
    uses: humanitec/build-push-to-humanitec@v1
      with:
        humanitec-token: ${{ secrets.HUMANITEC_TOKEN }}
        organization: awesome-company
        auto-tag: true
```

### `additional-docker-arguments`

> NOTE: You can provide multiple argument by placing them in one long list of commands, e.g., `--build-arg env1=value1 --build-arg env2=value2`.

```
